# OsmPlotting
simple plotting data using OSM do what ever you want with it.
if you want to change the country just replace the country code and if you want amenities to something different, have fun do what ever you find interesting, if you wnat to help I am working on adding variables so the user can input an ISO-3116-1 country code and have all the data.
